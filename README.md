# duvo-sre-task

> **Pre-task scaffold.** Everything up to tag `pre-task-scaffold` was prepared *before* the timed
> window: a generic, production-shaped service skeleton (API + worker, health probes, metrics,
> traces, logs, SLO alerts, Docker, Terraform for Cloud Run, CI). Work on the actual task starts
> after that tag — `git diff pre-task-scaffold..main` is exactly what was built in the hour.

## Summary
<!-- TASK: 2–3 sentences — what this does, for whom, and what "done" means here. -->

## Run it
```bash
make up      # api, worker, postgres, redis, grafana + prometheus + loki + tempo
make smoke   # end-to-end check
make test    # tests against real Postgres/Redis
make load    # k6 load test (p95 < 300ms, errors < 1%)
make chaos   # inject 30% job failures to watch retries/alerts (make chaos RATE=0 to stop)
make down
```

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| API docs (OpenAPI) | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| Grafana — "Duvo service" dashboard, traces, logs | http://localhost:3000 |
| Prometheus alerts | http://localhost:9090/alerts |

## Architecture
```
client ──POST /sandboxes {"type":"http"}──▶ api (producer) ──▶ Postgres (sandbox row = source of truth)
                    │  enqueue start_sandbox:{id} (deterministic id, trace context in args)
                    ▼
                 Redis (arq queue) ──▶ worker (consumer) ──▶ Postgres  queued → starting → running | failed
api + worker ──OTLP (traces, logs)──▶ OTel Collector ─▶ Tempo / Loki ─▶ Grafana
Prometheus ──scrape /metrics──▶ api :8000, worker :9100   (SLO burn-rate alerts)
```

## Decisions & trade-offs
| Decision | Why | Trade-off / revisit when |
|---|---|---|
| Sandbox row written *before* enqueue; enqueue failure marks it `failed` + 503 | Worker always finds its row; no sandbox is left looking `queued` forever | Caller retry creates a new sandbox — an `Idempotency-Key` header would fix that |
| `asyncio.timeout` around enqueue | arq sets only a *connect* timeout; a hung Redis would otherwise hang the request | No retry on enqueue: fail fast, caller retries |
| Worker skips sandboxes not in `queued`/`starting` | Queue delivery is at-least-once; a redelivered job must not start a sandbox twice | Relies on the DB row, not on arq's result store (`keep_result=0`) |
| `jobs_enqueued_total{outcome}` on the producer | Producer health visible separately from HTTP 5xx | 503s also burn the API SLO; no separate alert yet |
| `url`/`error` columns added in slice 1 | `create_all` never alters existing tables | Real migrations (Alembic) before production |
| Liveness (`/healthz`) ≠ readiness (`/readyz`) | A DB blip must not trigger a restart storm | — |
| Deterministic job ids | Duplicate requests don't double-process while a job is queued/running | Window ends when the job finishes; true exactly-once needs DB-level guards |
| Write status *before* enqueue, roll back on failure | A fast worker can't be overwritten by a late API write | Brief "queued" state if the process dies between the two steps |
| Prometheus pull for metrics, OTel for traces + logs | Matches a Prometheus/Grafana shop; deterministic metric names | On Cloud Run use Managed Service for Prometheus or OTLP metrics |
| Route templates as metric labels | Bounded cardinality whatever callers send | — |
| No tracing of the worker's Redis poll loop / `/metrics` scrapes | Keeps traces about real work, not polling | Redis latency comes from metrics instead |
| `create_all` at startup | Speed for a 1-hour task | Alembic migrations as a release step before >1 replica |
| One uvicorn process per container | Simple metrics + predictable memory; scale with replicas | — |

## Reliability & observability
- **SLOs:** [docs/SLO.md](docs/SLO.md) — alerts in `observability/prometheus/rules.yml`, runbook in [docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md).
- **Signals:** RED metrics per route, job outcomes/latency, queue depth; JSON logs with `trace_id`; one trace spans API → worker.
- **Failure modes considered:** <!-- TASK: table — failure | detection | mitigation -->

## Deploying to GCP (Cloud Run)
```bash
cd infra/terraform && cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # set project_id, image
terraform init && terraform apply
gcloud secrets versions add duvo-app-database-url --data-file=- <<< "postgresql+asyncpg://..."
```
Not provisioned here (next steps): Cloud SQL, Memorystore, Serverless VPC access, OTel collector.

## What I'd do next
<!-- TASK: prioritized list, most important first. -->

## Time log
- **Plan** — `PLAN.md`: thinnest end-to-end slice first, then containers → observability → A/B → metric cutover.
- **Slice 1 (step 1)** — replaced placeholder `items` with `sandboxes`: `POST/GET /sandboxes`, `start_sandbox` job, worker logs the work and marks `running`; producer metric; tests, smoke, k6 updated.
